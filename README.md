# Important
This fork of the NTR debugger can run most Gateshark cheat codes, but some of these codes will require you to format them a bit. Some codes which need to be executed on every frame will never work. Sending commands over the network is very insufficient for such a task. We'd need NTR to implement this by default with a specific command to controll this.
